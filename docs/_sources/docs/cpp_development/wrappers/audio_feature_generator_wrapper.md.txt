# AudioFeatureGenerator Python Wrapper

This is a C++ Python wrapper that allows for executing the ReRAM Engine AudioFeatureGenerator component from a Python script.

This is useful as it allows for using the _exact_ same spectrogram generation algorithms between the Python model training scripts
and embedded device at runtime.


This wrapper is made accessible to a Python script via the [AudioFeatureGenerator](yzlite.core.preprocess.audio.audio_feature_generator.AudioFeatureGenerator) python API.
This Python API loads the C++ Python wrapper shared library into the Python runtime.

Refer to the AudioFeatureGenerator [documentation](../../../../docs/audio/audio_feature_generator.md) for more details


## Source Code

- [Python wrapper](https://github.com/ReRAM-Labs/yzlite/tree/master/cpp//audio_feature_generator_wrapper) - This makes the AudioFeatureGenerator C++ library accessible to Python
- [C++ library](https://github.com/ReRAM-Labs/yzlite/tree/master/cpp//shared/reram_sdk/audio_feature_generation) - The C++ library, this invokes the Microfrontend to generate spectrograms
- [Microfrontend](https://github.com/ReRAM-Labs/yzlite/tree/master/cpp//shared/microfrontend) - Google-provided audio processing library to generate spectrograms
- [Python API](https://github.com/ReRAM-Labs/yzlite/tree/master/yzlite/core//preprocess/audio/audio_feature_generator) - Python package that loads this C++ wrapper

## Building the Wrapper

### Pre-built

This wrapper comes pre-built when installing the YZLITE Python package, e.g.:

```shell
pip install yizhu-yzlite
```


### Automatic Build

This wrapper is automatically built when installing from source, e.g.:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ReRAM-Labs/yzlite.git
cd yzlite
pip install -e .
```

### Manual build via YZLITE command

To manually build this wrapper, issue the YZLITE command:

```shell
yzlite build audio_feature_generator_wrapper
```


### Manual build via CMake

This wrapper can also be built via CMake using [Visual Studio Code](../../../../docs/cpp_development/vscode.md) or the [Command Line](../../../../docs/cpp_development/command_line.md).

To build the wrapper, the [build_options.cmake](../../../../docs/cpp_development/build_options.md) file needs to be modified.

Create the file `<yzlite repo root>/user_options.cmake` and add:

```
yzlite_set(YZLITE_TARGET yzlite_audio_feature_generator_wrapper)
```

```{note}
You must remove this option and clean the build directory before building the example applications
```

Then configure the CMake project using the Window/Linux GCC toolchain and build the target: `yzlite_audio_feature_generator_wrapper`.
