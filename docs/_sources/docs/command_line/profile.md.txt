# profile
Profile a model to determine how efficiently is may run on hardware.
This will profile a YZLITE model or .tflite model file
in a simulator or on a locally connected, embedded device.

__NOTE:__ *Any* .tflite model file supported by Tensorflow-Lite Micro will
work with this command (i.e. The .tflite does NOT need to be generated by the YZLITE).
