 Usage: yzlite train [OPTIONS] <model>

 Train an ML model
 This trains a model using the configuration specified in the given YZLITE model.

 All training results are stored <model log dir>/train.
 After training completes, an archive file is generated at:
   <YZLITE model directory>/<YZLITE model name>.yzlite.zip
 which contains:
 - YZLITE model specification python script
 - Keras model in .h5 format
 - Quantized .tflite model
 - Model summary
 - Training log

 For more details see:

 ----------
  Examples
 ----------

 # Execute model training dryrun
 yzlite train image_example1-test

 # Clean any previous training logs & checkpoints,
 # then train for 100 epochs
 yzlite train image_example1 --clean --epochs 100

 # Resume model from previous session at the last save checkpoint
 yzlite train image_example1 --resume

 # Resume model from previous session at epoch 43
 yzlite train image_example1 --resume-epoch 43

 # Do NOT evaluate the model after training
 yzlite train image_example1 --no-evaluate

 Arguments
 *    model      <model>  Name of YZLITE model OR path to model specification python script.                    [default: None] [required]
                          If YZLITE model name given, optionally append "-test" to execute a training "dryrun".
                          This ensures everything works by quickly training the model;
                          Dry-run training limits the number of epochs and dataset size.
                          All results are stored in a test directory and archive.

 Options
 --epochs        -e                   <epochs>   Override the number of training epochs define by the YZLITE model [default: None]
 --weights       -w                   <weights>  Optional, load weights from previous training session.                             [default: None]
                                                 May be one of the following:
                                                 - If option omitted then trained with initial weights
                                                 - Absolute path to a generated weights .h5 file generated by Keras during training
                                                 - The keyword 'best'; find the best weights from the previous training session
                                                 - Filename of .h5 in <model log dir>/train/weights
 --verbose       -v                              Enable verbose console logs
 --resume            --no-resume                 Resume the training from a previous training session using the last stored checkpoint weights [default: no-resume]
 --resume-epoch                       <epoch>    Specify the epoch to resume training [default: 0]
 --clean             --no-clean                  Clean all previous training logs files, weights, and checkpoints [default: no-clean]
 --show              --no-show                   Display the generated model training history diagram [default: no-show]
 --evaluate          --no-evaluate               After training, evaluate the .h5 and .tflite models [default: evaluate]
 --test              --no-test                   Do a dryrun of training the model. This does the same thing as: yzlite train my_model-test [default: no-test]
 --post                                          This allows for post-processing the training results (e.g. uploading to a cloud) if supported by the given YZLiteModel
 --help                                          Show this message and exit.
