label: CMSIS-NN Optimized Kernels
description: >
  This component includes kernel implementations that are optimized for certain CPU
  architectures using CMSIS-NN. By including this component, the optimized kernel implementations
  will be used instead of the reference kernels.

  The kernels which have optimized implementations are: add, conv, depthwise_conv,
  fully_connected, mul, pooling and softmax. Remaining kernels fall back to using the
  reference kernel implementations.
